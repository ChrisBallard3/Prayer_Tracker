Description of the app:

This is a prayer tracking app. For all the times you tell someone you'll pray for them and never do. You can add a prayer and a description of the prayer if you'd like. If you no longer wish to pray for something you can delete it, but if the prayer has been answered, mark it as such, and it will continue to be there to see your answered prayers.
